# Text In a Jar

Text In a Jar is a web app that allows users to pull random chosen text from a database and put their own text in.

I thought it would be a simple and fun way to work on my testing skills as well as learn MYSQL (I've been using Mongodb for all my projects so far).

## Tech Stack

- AWS (MYSQL Database)
- Playwright (Testing)
- NextJS (Backend API and Frontend React Interface)
